# Day 3: Nested Lists and Tables

Welcome to **Day 3** of the Web Development Challenge!  
Today, I focused on learning about **nested lists** and **tables** in HTML.

## Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Nested Lists

- Learned how to create lists within lists, both ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`).
- Practiced building multi-level structures for better content organization.
- Explored practical use cases, such as navigation menus, documentation outlines, and FAQs.

#### Example of a Nested List:
```html
<ul>
  <li>Fruits
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vegetables
    <ul>
      <li>Carrot</li>
      <li>Potato</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

### 2️⃣ Tables

- Studied the structure of tables using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.
- Understood how to display tabular data and apply basic formatting.
- Practiced building tables for displaying information such as schedules, price lists, and contact details.

#### Example of a Table:
```html
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alice</td>
    <td>24</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bob</td>
    <td>27</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
