# Web_development_challenge

Welcome — I'm Shivam Shukla. This repository documents my 100-day web development challenge where I learn, practice, and share summaries of essential web development technologies. I'm following the "Coder Army" (Rohit Negi) web development videos as a primary guide and using this repo as both a learning log and motivation to stay consistent.

> Note: This repo's main purpose is personal learning and motivation. It may not be a polished resource for others, but I hope parts of it can inspire or help someone on a similar journey.

## Goals

- Stay consistent and learn web development for 100 days.
- Build a strong foundation in essential web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and at least one frontend framework (e.g., React).
- Summarize daily learning, small projects, and notes so I can look back and track progress.
- Share work and progress publicly to stay accountable.

## What I'll cover / Tech stack

I will focus on (but am not limited to):

- HTML5 & Semantic markup
- CSS3 (flexbox, grid, responsive design)
- JavaScript (ES6+, DOM, fetch/AJAX)
- Version control: Git & GitHub
- Package managers & build tools (npm, vite/webpack)
- Frontend framework basics (React or similar)
- Basic backend concepts (Node.js, Express) — optional small demos
- Deployment basics (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

---

## Daily plan / structure

I will try to follow a simple daily routine to keep learning focused:

- Watch a lesson or read a short tutorial (30–60 minutes)
- Try a small hands-on exercise or mini-project (30–90 minutes)
- Write a short summary or notes about what I learned (15–30 minutes)
- Commit and push my notes/code to this repo

Suggested folder structure:
- /day-001/
  - notes.md
  - project/ (small demo or exercise)
  - screenshot.png (optional)
- /day-002/
  - ...
- README.md (this file)
- resources.md (links and useful references)

Example `notes.md` structure:
- Date
- Topic / Video name
- Key concepts learned (bullet points)
- Code snippets / resources
- What I want to improve tomorrow

---

## Progress tracking

- I will create a directory for each day (day-001, day-002, …).
- Each day folder will include brief notes and any demo code.
- I'll tag milestones (for example: day-30, day-60, day-100) with a short summary and any projects built.

---

## Resources & references

Primary guide:
- Coder Army — Rohit Negi (YouTube)

Other helpful resources:
- MDN Web Docs (HTML, CSS, JS)
- freeCodeCamp
- Official docs for React / Node
- CSS Tricks

(Will add more links to resources.md as I collect them.)

## How to use this repository

- Browse the day folders to see what I learned each day.
- Use the notes for quick summaries or inspiration for your own learning.
- If you see something incorrect in my notes, feel free to open an issue or suggest an improvement.

## Contribution & collaboration

This is primarily my learning repository, but I welcome:
- Suggestions for resources
- Corrections or small improvements via pull requests
- Encouraging issues or short challenges

If you want to collaborate, open an issue or a PR and we can discuss.

## Tips for staying consistent (what helps me)

- Set a realistic daily timebox (even 30 minutes is progress).
- Keep notes short and actionable.
- Build small, incremental projects — they compound.
- Share progress publicly to stay accountable.
- Be kind to yourself — consistency > perfection.

Thank you for visiting. I'm excited to learn and grow over the next 100 days — and I'll keep this repo updated with daily notes and small projects.
